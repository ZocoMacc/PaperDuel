# PaperDuel
PaperDuel is a gamified backtesting platform where users compete by running trading strategies on the same ES Futures dataset. Built for a 24-hour hackathon, PaperDuel combines a React frontend, Express API, and a lightweight Python backtest engine that processes historical ES data to calculate PnL, drawdowns, and equity curves.
