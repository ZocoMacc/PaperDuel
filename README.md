# PaperDuel
PaperDuel is a mini app for head-to-head trading backtests on historical ES futures data.
- Two tabs: Home Profile (stats) and Joined Battles (active/finished battles & leaderboard)
- Fair rules: same data window, fixed fees/slippage, same starting capital
- 24h hackathon build: React (frontend), Express (API), simple worker (Python/Node)
